# binary-search-tree
This was my first attempt at a JavaScript Binary Search Tree!

I created a Binary Search Tree object with many methods to create nodes (Node object), delete nodes, get information about the tree such as if the tree is balanced or not...
Many traversal methods, etc...

Live demo (play with console): https://qzmp10.github.io/binary-search-tree/
